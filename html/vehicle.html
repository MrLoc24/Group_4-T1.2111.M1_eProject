        Real Time AWD with Intelligent Control System™ allows the HR-V to
        proactively send power to the rear wheels, helping prevent traction loss
        during inclement weather or on unreliable surfaces. It's yet another
        HR-V feature designed to provide confidence and peace of mind.

      <h3>Ford F-Series</h3>
      <p>LONGEST BEST-SELLING FOR TRUCKS</p>
      <p>
        For the past four decades, we've carried this claim with pride: Ford
        F-Series-The best-selling trucks for 45 years. * But we couldn't have
        done it without you. We won't get into all the reasons why here and now,
        but as you explore you'll start to see why. And for the first time we
        have a full lineup of gas, hybrid and all-electric F-150® trucks in the
        family.

      <h3>Suzuki</h3>
      <p>
        "A vehicle that can take on rough roads and go to places that cars
        couldn't go in the past"
      </p>
      <p>
        With this philosophy, our first four-wheel drive model was developed in
        1970. This was the start of allgrip, Suzuki's renowned four-wheel drive
        technology.
